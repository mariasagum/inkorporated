              "Submarines weren't there"

              Fiona, as a young child, always had the wildest imagination, which followed her throughout her
              <br>
              adult life. Fiona had a surprising turning point in her life, she suddenly had a grand dream to 
              <br>
             become the first American astronaut to eat a doughnut in space; you could say it was a far-out
              <br>
             dream. Though the wide public was not aware that we were capable of space travel yet, Fiona knew
              <br>
              and was determined to follow through on her dream. She contacted the then very very secret
              <br>
              government operation of NASA and accomplished her aspiration of eating that moist, rainbow 
              <br>
              sprinkle covered doughnut in the great beyond. Contrary to popular belief Fiona Gray was the
              <br>
              first person in space, not Yuri Gagarin.

              She is the reincarnated Bobby Flay; they have the same birthday so it makes sense. 
              <br>
              She also knows exactly what you're about to say. She's basically a mind reader, but not.
